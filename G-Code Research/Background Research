Most modern CNC machines are based on FANUC G-Code with extra commands and cycles that are exclusive to the make or model of your machine.
A good example of this is the use of M-codes. One dual spindle CNC Lathe may use the M-code M110 to open the collet of the sub spindle while another may use M220.
Reading through the book that came with your machine tool while the cycle is running is a great way to understand the features that set your machine apart from machines that you may have operated and programmed in the past.
If your place of work has misplaced this reference/programming manual don’t panic. Most can be downloaded for free from the manufacturer’s website.
